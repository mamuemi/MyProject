# the goal: i want to measure and visualize the similarity of two jobs (and optionally the probability that they are falling into the same job category). examples: sales manager is very similar to account manager, both are in the category sales.
# taken steps: obtain data from web crawl (json, Scrapy); clean data: delete empty dup entries, stop words, punctuation (python); do and visualize word count of job profiles as bar plot (mathplot); extract data as csv and generate word cloud with R
